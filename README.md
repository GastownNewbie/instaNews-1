## What I Learned
In this project I learned jQuery, Ajax API, the importance of Accessibility and how to properly audit your code for best practices using Developer Tools. I was able to get the site to have 100% on it's Chrome Developer Tools audit:

## Acknowledgments
Not only did I have piles of help from Google, I would not have been able to get over some major hurdles without the help of my cohort members, specifically Lovely, Andrew, Vera and Tenzin.
